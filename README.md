# Hello-World
New to GitHub Noob to programming. Looking to become functional within the next year or two.
I've only recently expressed interest in learning to code and pursue graphic design interests as a part of challenging my fears of failure and commitment to remaining creative.
Signing up to be a part of the GitHub community and other platforms like it is a decidedly less narcissism oriented alternative to the social media world.
I am hoping these are the right steps to take towards developing in the areas I'd like to.
